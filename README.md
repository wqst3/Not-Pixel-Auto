# Not-Pixel-auto

## **Description**

A script to automate Not Pixel, having a console interface to set up a path to Telegram and run the process. The script opens Not Pixel every hour, opens fren template, looks for incorrectly colored pixels and corrects them. Also, if the palette color does not match the correct one, the script changes it to the correct one.

**The project was created for educational purposes.**

## **Requirements**

* `Windows(I've only tested on 11)`;
* `C++ >= 20`;

## **Getting started**

1. Compile main.cpp with User32.dll and gdi32.dll libraries
2. Go to [Not Pixel](https://t.me/notpixel/app?startapp=f988254241_s578208) and add a [fren template](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b2c6ae5-9cd5-4231-b858-7556871412cf).
3. Close Not Pixel and run the script.

## **From myself**

This is my first project on github and I would love to hear criticism and suggestions from you. But most likely this project will not be updated due to Not Pixel's imminent release on exchanges. But it doesn't mean that I'm abandoning my GitHub, I still have a lot of interesting ideas that I'm going to realize.
